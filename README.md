# TV-Show-Web-application
TV Shows web application  using NodeJs.

This application is created with the purpose of being able to keep track of the shows that you are watching, receive recommendations and discover new shows.
I created this application using Nodejs for the Backend, and Bootstrap with SemanticUi for the Frontend. While creating this, I had the opportunity to work with many of the popular frameworks, like express.
As for the database, I used MongoDB with Mongoose. Since my plan was to create a dynamic application, I started using EJS as a view engine.
For registration and login purposes, I used "passport" and "passport-local", which makes it a pretty secure process. For the raw data of shows, I used an API provided by the TVDB team, from which I requested a key and the rights to use this data with no commercial use in plan.

This application is still in development, and I will try to bring to it as much features as I can.
